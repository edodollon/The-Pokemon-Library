# Project Introduction

The Pokemon Library is a project created by [Jomel Edodollon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jomel-edodollon/) utilizing the [Next.js React Framework](https://nextjs.org/) with data coming from the [Pokemon TCG API](https://docs.pokemontcg.io/).

This project served as an introduction to the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Framework for React and a demonstration of the ability to utilize data coming from a 3rd party API. The app was also a great platform to practice and show responsive styling and design using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).
